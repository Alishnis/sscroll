SmartScroll is an educational tool that transforms distracting social media content into structured learning materials.

Instead of endless scrolling, SmartScroll reframes content from platforms like YouTube and Reddit into:
	•	concise summaries
	•	auto-generated quizzes
	•	note-taking blocks

The goal is not to block social media, but to redirect attention toward learning using the same platforms students already engage with.
